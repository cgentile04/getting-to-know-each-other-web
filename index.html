<h2>Introduction</h2>
	<p>My name is Charles Gentile. I prefer to be called Chuckie. I am Sophomore and my major is Mathematics. I plan to add a focus in Actuarial Science. I work for my family's yard sign business called "Celebrate With A Yard Card." My current responsibilities are preparing/packing, installing, and taking down the yard signs. Otherwise, I help with inventory control and keeping our workspace organized. I also have on-campus job as a New Flyer Guide. My role for this job is to welcome all the incoming Lewis students each year and show them around campus. Our main goal is to ensure that these students have a positive experience during Welcome Week. This helps set the tone for the rest of their time at Lewis. I have resided in Manhattan, Illinois for my entire life. Some people do not like the concept of a "small town where everybody knows everybody," but I have always enjoyed getting to know my neighbors on a deeper level and recognizing many faces when running errands. I commute to Lewis, which is a little different than driving to my high school but not much farther. The nice part about college is that I can choose which times I want to take my classes, which determines when I need to drive to school. With my degree in Mathematics and focus in Actuarial Science, I plan to become an actuary. This is a position associated with the finance department of most companies. The main aspect of this job is to execute financial risk assessments. This means I would evaluate the likelihood of whether a financial asset or investment could lose value. Based on the results of this numerical analysis, I would provide a forecast of the change in value to companies that I am working for. Based on this, I would recommend what they should do to reap the most long-term financial benefits. Actuaries can also work for individuals, especially those looking to invest in the stock market. In general, I have always been a problem solver, particularly in the field of Mathematics. In addition to this, I am very disciplined in budgeting my own money. With this in mind, I realized that this profession is a perfect opportunity for me to do the same for others.</p>

<h2>My Favorite Hobby/Activity</h2>
	Ever since I saw my brother, Ryan, first play the drums, I was mesmerized and motivated to do the same thing. Ever since 5th grade, I have been increasingly involved in my schools' music departments, participating in concert band, marching band, jazz band, pep band, and indoor drumline. Once I began high school at Lincoln-Way West, my main focus was the Lincoln-Way Marching Band. I was on the Snareline (Drumline) for all 4 years of high school. I had countless memorable experiences during my time in marching band, including marching in the Rose Bowl and Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parades in Pasadena, California and New York City, respectively. We also managed to become the Illinois State Champions 3 times during my time at Lincoln-Way (minus 2020). Contrary to my marching band experience, I played drumset in jazz band and learned a lot about music throughout my 4 years. I may eventually join the jazz band at Lewis to resume my experience with jazz at the college level. Even though I am not as heavily involved with music as I was in high school, I will continue to keep touch with it off campus as a hobby.
